# Drone Safety Rules (Tight)

- Maintain minimum distance from humans/animals; no close flights without approval
- Respect local airspace laws; no-fly zones honored
- Pre-flight checks: battery, props, GPS lock, failsafe return
- Weather thresholds: wind, rain, visibility limits enforced
- Emergency procedures: land immediately on critical alerts
- Log all flights with timestamps, operator, and mission purpose
